Mini Challenge 2 - Say Hello Endpoint

This is a web API project that will take the users input in the url and print it back into a statement as "Hello {name} I hope you're having a great day today! You're doing great! You got this!"

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman you can hit the plus sign at the top of postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a browser or Postman, add /MiniCh2/Hello to the end. For example: https://localhost:7129/MiniCh2/Hello would be the URL you end up with.
7. At this point you're almost done! Just add a /yourNameGoesHere at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7129/MiniCh2/Hello/Brandon
8. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.
